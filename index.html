        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ’¼</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently studying political science to become a lawyer, as it is my goal to help those in situations where they need some guidance. Iâ€™ve always been interested in the legal system and feel like it is my duty to be a part of it. While I know the system is unfair at times, I want to be able to bring some positive change that will grant more freedom to those that are deserving, instead of closing the doors for them. I have read or heard of minorities given unfair trials simply because of their race while white men or women be given less time for charges that are far more serious. I believe situations like this happen because many minorities cannot afford a good lawyer or the system fails to see the person beyond race.<br><br>

        The jobs I have had have not prepared me well for the career I desire because they have all focused on food, but they have helped me gain customer service experience, which is what I will need in order to be a good lawyer. I started working from when I was sixteen up until now, so Iâ€™ve had a good amount of time gaining experience with all kinds of people. Throughout that time, Iâ€™ve learned the difficulties  that come with any type of job. The importance of good customer service means that person is able to feel comfortable talking to you. I learned to always respond with a positive attitude because it is what I would want in return. The kindness I receive back is always a good feeling which can go a long way. At my first job, I was mainly on drive-thru where we had to finish orders in around three minutes or less. Unfortunately, this wasnâ€™t always accomplished, especially when we got super busy. Despite the importance of having orders out in a desired time, I thought it was more important to make sure the customer was satisfied. I remember a lady took really long to order, but it was because she was unsure of what she wanted and my manager just wanted me to get the order done with. I proceeded to help her without making her feel pressured and she thanked me for being patient. I still remember  that moment because although her order took longer than it shouldâ€™ve, her kindness towards me mattered more.<br><br>

        With the jobs Iâ€™ve had, I was able to build a good relationship with most of my coworkers. Being able to work with the people around me is important because I think a place of work is where you should also feel comfortable. At my current job, I hang out with my coworkers outside of work because weâ€™ve been able to get along with each other outside of work and appreciate each other's presence. Thereâ€™s been a couple coworkers Iâ€™ve had to work with where we didnâ€™t work the best, but it doesnâ€™t mean it has to be dreadful. Getting the job done is whatâ€™s more important.
